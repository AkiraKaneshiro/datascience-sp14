# Introduction to Data Science

Organizations use their data for decision support and to build data-intensive
products and services. The collection of skills required by organizations to
support these functions has been grouped under the term Data Science. This
course will attempt to articulate the expected output of Data Scientists and
then equip the students with the ability to deliver against these expectations.
The assignments will involve web programming, statistics, and the ability to
manipulate data sets with code.
